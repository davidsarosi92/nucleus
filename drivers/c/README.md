# libnucleus — the C driver

C99, no dependencies (POSIX sockets; Winsock on Windows — not yet tested in
CI).  `nucleus.h` documents the API: `nc_connect`, `nc_query` (the last
statement's result, or NULL with an `nc_error` holding the SQLSTATE),
`nc_value_at`, `nc_format`, `nc_close`.  Values are `nc_value` (numeric as a
128-bit mantissa and scale, dates as days and timestamps as µs since
2000-01-01, `uuid` as an `nc_uuid` of 16 bytes — `nc_uuid_value`,
`nc_uuid_parse` — and another registered type as `NC_EXT`, its name and
binary form; `nc_column_type_name` names a registered column type).

```sh
make                # build/libnucleus.a
make test           # build/test_nucleus (needs a running server)
```

Or compile `nucleus.c` into your program.  Example: `examples/c/quickstart.c`.
