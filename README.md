# nucleus

A layered, multi-model database written in Rust from scratch.  Its core is a
transactional, ordered key-value engine; SQL and document models are built on
top of it, and a distributed implementation of the same KV contract comes
later — without changing the layers above.

**Status:** early.  The platform layer (§M0) exists; the storage engine is
next.  See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the roadmap and [DOCS.md](DOCS.md) for what
exists today.

## Building

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

The toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; rustup installs it on
first use.  nucleus builds for Linux, macOS, Windows and
[d-os](https://github.com/davidsarosi92/d-os) (PLAN.md, "Build targets").
